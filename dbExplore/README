HI!
I MADE THIS PROGRAM VERY QUICKLY OUT OF 
THE NECESSITY TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN SEVERAL 
INTERACTING MYSQL TABLES. BECAUSE I MADE IT HASTILY,
IT IS VERY BUGGY, AND SENSITIVE DATA IS NOT HANDLED 
IN A SECURE FASHION.

!!!DO NOT USE ON THE OPEN INTERNET (I ONLY USE IT ON XAMPP)!!!

That said, I found it useful for examining and making small changes in databases.
Use at your own risk.

KNOWN ISSUES:
1.Connection variables stored unencrypted, in /includes/db_cfg/dbCfg.php.
2.MySQL input is not sanitized.
